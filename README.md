## Description

To streamline the process of setting up joint savings accounts, a Solidity smart contract will be developed. This contract will allow two users to control a joint savings account by inputting their respective addresses. The contract will utilize ether management functions to meet the financial institution's requirements and provide the necessary features for the joint savings account.
